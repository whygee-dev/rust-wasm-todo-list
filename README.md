## What does each file do?

- `Cargo.toml` contains the standard Rust metadata. You put your Rust dependencies in here. You must change this file with your details (name, description, version, authors, categories)

- `package.json` contains the standard npm metadata. You put your JavaScript dependencies in here. You must change this file with your details (author, name, version)

- The `js` folder contains your JavaScript code (`index.js` is used to hook everything into Webpack, you don't need to change it).

- The `src` folder contains your Rust code.

- The `static` folder contains any files that you want copied as-is into the final build. It contains an `index.html` file which loads the `index.js` file.
